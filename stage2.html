            <h1>How to select suitable goals</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This section will focus on setting goals which suit you mostly based off of the activities you completed in stage 1. Look at the responses you put for some of the activities and consider what you want to improve on. Aim to have one academic
                and one life skill goal.</p>
            Heres a recap of this stage!(click to expand image)<br>

            <h3>Reading</h3><br>
            <p>heres a few resources related to this topic: </p>
            <a href="#">Locke and Lathams book</a>
            <a href="#">Academic papers</a>
            <br><br>

            <h3>Academic goal</h3><br>
            <p>First on an acadmic goal to help you decide how to improve yourself academically, essentially something which will help you do well in your studies.</p>
            Below are some examples of goals set by previous students to help you decide on a goal.<br><br>

            <div id="wordbox1" style="font-size: 20px;">GENERATE A SUGGESTION</div><br>
            <div class="dropbtn2" onclick="PickRandomWord('wordbox1',1)" style="width:150px; height: 75px;">GENERATE</div>

            <!--
			[EXAMPLES HERE] - examples could be a table with what skill the goal helps with? i.e. [SELF RELIANCE][COOKING]
			<table style ="width = 100% " class = "">
			<tr>
			<th style = "width = 60%;padding: 8px;">Goal</th><th style = "width = 35%;padding: 8px;">Relevent skill</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td style = "width = 60%;padding: 8px;">To achieve a first in a first semester module</td><td>Study skills, time management</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>beep     afafaf</td>
			<td>beep</td>
			</tr>
			</table>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Life skill goal</h3><br>
            <p>The second goal is a life skill, something more focused on how you live, preferably to do with transitioning and adjusting to uni life. Maybe you want to get better at cooking for yourself or meeting new people? </p>
            Below are some examples of goals set by previous students.<br><br>

            <div id="wordbox2" style="font-size: 20px;">
                <div>GENERATE A SUGGESTION</div>
            </div><br>
            <div class="dropbtn2" onclick="PickRandomWord('wordbox2',2)" style="width:150px; height: 75px;">GENERATE</div>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Activity</h3>
            <p>If you haven't got your ideas yet theres a few activities to try.<br> The first is to brainstorm university relevent areas you want to work on, study skills, time management, that sort of thing to get some ideas for an academic goal, then
                do the same for a life skill goal.<br> Maybe you could make a mind map with a split between academic and life skills.<br> Once you have your goals, consider asking people you know for feedback, maybe they can point out something you hadn't
                thought of and improve your goals!<br> Try not to change them entirely though!
