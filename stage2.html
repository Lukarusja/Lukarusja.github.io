            <h1>How to select suitable goals</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This section will focus on setting goals which suit you mostly based off of the activities you completed in stage 1. Look at the responses you put for some of the activities and consider what you want to improve on. Aim to have one academic
                and one life skill goal.</p>
            Heres a recap of this stage!<br>

            <h3>Academic goal</h3><br>
            <p>An acadmic goal will help you decide how to improve yourself acadimically, </p>
            Below are some examples of goals set by previous students.<br> [EXAMPLES HERE] - examples could be a table with what skill the goal helps with? i.e. [SELF RELIANCE][COOKING]
            <table style="width: 100% ">
                <tr>
                    <th style="width: 60%;padding: 8px;">Goal</th>
                    <th style="width: 35%;padding: 8px;">Relevent skill</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="width: 60%;padding: 8px;">To achieve a first in a first semester module</td>
                    <td>Study skills, time management</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>beep afafaf</td>
                    <td>beep</td>
                </tr>

            </table>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Life skill goal</h3><br>
            <p>this goal is more focused on how you live, preferably to do with transitioning and adjusting to uni life. Maybe you want to get better at cooking for yourself or meeting new people?
            </p>
            Below are some examples of goals set by previous students.<br> [EXAMPLES HERE]
            <br><br>
            <h3>Activity</h3>
            <p>There are a few activities you could try in order to get ideas for this, the first is to brainstorm university relevent areas you want to work on, study skills, time management, that sort of thing.</p>
            <p>
                Once you have your goals, consider asking people you know for feedback, maybe they can point out something you hadn't thought of and improve your goals! Dont change them entirely though!
