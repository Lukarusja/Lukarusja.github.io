            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hi, we are so glad to have you here! In this series of five activities we will go through each stage of the RGS Lanyard. What is it, you ask? Let us talk you through each stage one by one!</p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>Stage 1</h3><br>
            <p>Stage 1 is all about enhancing your self-awareness. During it you will have to reflect on your past and all the feedback you have had and build a consistent story you will follow during the later stages. Fun fact, you are in this stage right
                now!
            </p><br>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Stage 2</h3><br>
            <p>During Stage 2 you will set yourself a goal you want to be working towards. That is the main focus of this entire course, so think really hard on what you want to achieve!
            </p><br>
            <img src="assets/images/stage2slide.png" class="task-image" onclick="changeSize('imgid2')" id="imgid2" style="width:40%; transition: width 1s;">

            <br><br>
            <h3>Stage 3</h3><br>
            <p>This is why the goal you set in Stage 2 was so important - it is the main focus of this and the next stages. During this one you will have to reflect on your goal
            </p><br>
            <img src="assets/images/stage3slide.png" class="task-image" onclick="changeSize('imgid3')" id="imgid3" style="width:40%; transition: width 1s;">


            <br><br>
            <h3>Stage 4</h3><br>
            <p>As said in the previous stage, you will think even more about your goal during this one!
            </p><br>
            <img src="assets/images/stage4slide.png" class="task-image" onclick="changeSize('imgid4')" id="imgid4" style="width:40%; transition: width 1s;">

            <br><br>
            <h3>Stage 5</h3><br>
            <p>Here you are going to actually start working on your very well thought out goal through the means you come up with during this stage
            </p><br>
            <img src="assets/images/stage5slide.png" class="task-image" onclick="changeSize('imgid5')" id="imgid5" style="width:40%; transition: width 1s;">
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Let's get started</h2><br>
            <p>Since now you know how each stage is going to look like, we can finally get started!
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <h3>Myers Briggs</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Take the Myers Briggs test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">here</a> right now before moving on to the next paragraph. This is crucial as your personality type is the foundation of everything you are going to
                do on this course from this point onwards.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Done? Great! Now download this document and enter your scores in the table - save it in a secure location as it will prove useful during the later stages</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now that you know which personality type you have, read the description of it, especially the 'Strengths and weaknesses' tab. While reading, try to find an area in which you can better yourself and set a goal to do so. The example goals are:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>goal 1</li>
                <li>goal 2</li>
                <li>goal 3</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>Also, consider your school reports or any kind of jobs you've had and the kind of feedback that you've had. Build your consistent story. </p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Last activity for today</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Meet/call/text any of your significant others and tell them about everything you did during the activities on this page. Also, tell them about your goal you set earlier and get feedback from them - they know you like nobody else does so if
                anyone can give you any tips on achieveing that goal, it's them!</p>
