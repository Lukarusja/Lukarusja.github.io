            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Let me just remind you what this stage is about:</p>
            <br><br>
            <img src="assets/images/stage3slide.png" class="task-image" onclick="changeSize('imgid')" id="imgid" style="width:40%; transition: width 1s;">
            <br><br>
            <p>Today we will focus on visualising yourself successfuly reaching your goal. But you have already done that in your free time, haven't you? Maybe even multiple times. Well, now you will learn how to do it properly so that it helps you actually
                achieve what you are pursuing!</p>

            <br><br>
            <h2>Day-dreaming time!</h2>
            <br>

            <p>This stage begins in a very pleasant way! The thing we are asking you right now is that you visualize yourself performing effectively in the are that you have chosen, be it academic or life skills. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Think about for 5 minutes or so and try to visualize/remember every little detail of your vision.</p>
            <h1 class="placeholder">is this enough for visualization?</h1>
            <br>
            <Br>
            <h2>Perfomance gap</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>While you are imagining yourself that you did manage to achieve your goal and how happy you are, it is just day-dreaming at the end of the day - so it is not the reality unfortunately (at least not yet!). Although, let me ask you a very important
                question you probably didn't ask yourself before: <br><br>What are the differences between your current situation and the one you were just imagining in the previous task?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Compare <b>'now'</b> with <b>'ideal'</b> and then write the differences down. Do you know what you have to do in order to erase these differences? Think about the <b>actions</b> you have to take and also write them down (so that you don't
                forget them, we wouldn't want that, would we?) </p>
            <h1 class="placeholder">is this activity 'guided' enough?</h1>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Time management</h2>
            <br>
            <p>It doesn't matter what your goal area is, time management is a crucial part of achieving stuff in life. If yours is bad, don't worry - we have an excellent technique for you! </p><br>
            <p>It is called 'pomodoro technique' and it basically requires you to think about time not as minutes or seconds but as tomatoes. Yes, tomatoes. I'm not going insane, hear me out!</p>
            <br>
            <p>One tomato is equal to 25 minutes. Keep this in mind as it is important. Now, choose a task you want to complete (write a report for an assignment for example) and before you start working, set a timer that will ring in 25 minutes. You are
                NOT allowed to get distracted by anything during those 25 minutes, and I mean anything - no checking emails, no replying to messages, nothing. You can do all of that when the timer rings but you will have just 5 minutes to do it. When
                your break ends, you have to set a timer for another 25 minutes and repeat the cycle until you finish. Seems easy, right? Just for your sake, every 3-4 tomatoes do a 15 minute break instead of 5, this will help you concentrate (like a
                tomato :D) </p>

            <br><br>
            <p>So just to recap:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>each tomato is equal to 25 minutes</li>
                <li>you can't do anything other than your task during those tomatoes</li>
                <li>after each tomato have a 5 minute break</li>
                <li>have a 15 minute break each 3-4 tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 class="placeholder">also, put some more articles in here</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>If you want to read more about this technique or if you want to know why it's called 'pomodoro' and relies on tomatoes, you can read
                <a href="/assets/files/pomodoro.pdf" download>this paper!</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Role models</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Everyone admires somebody including both you and me. Why are we admiring them though? Why do we want to be like them, or even themselves? That is because they have some traits we don't and we really want them.</p><br>
            <p>The chances are, you admire someone because they have already achieved the thing you are after right now - here is where the next part of this stage comes in:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Think about your role models - why you admire them, what did they do to achieve what they currently have and what are they doing that you are not?</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1 class="placeholder">The examples of utilising role models would be here if we had them lmao</h1>
